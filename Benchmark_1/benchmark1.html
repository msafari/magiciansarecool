  <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

  <p>This document describes a game called "Misuse of Magic", which is designed to be a simple, 2D side-scroller. The game will employ sprite-based animation, tiled backgrounds, collision detection, phyics specially gravity, AI, side scrolling &amp; and basic 2D game techniques.</p>
<br />

  <h3>TECHNOLOGY</h3>

  <p>Misuse of Magic will be web game deployed to Firebase using JavaScript and Phaser framework. Artwork will be mostly simple flat designs, and so we'll be using Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and Sketch for wire frames. Original music and sound effects will be made using Audacity and Ableton.</p>
<br />

  <h3>BACK STORY</h3>

  <p> 
Set in a future where wizards have mastered teleportation, society stretches across many planets. After failing a magical exam, Tzarha is sent into exile and lives on a desolate planet training her skills to one day return and pass. However, one day she is approached by an elderly wizard looking for a protege and she accepts. He studies magic that emulates scientific phenomena - in particular, gravity bending, pyrotechnics, and lightning. 

Unfortunately, power does things to those who have little self-control, and Tzarha is about to find herself on a life-changing journey.</p>
<br />

  <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>

  <p>The objecive is to lead the character on her journey to self discovery. Along the way she will battle several types of enemies to gain strength. Her happiness is also reflected in her skintone, which is an icy blue that over time fades as she finds her happiness.
  <ul>
  	<li>Elemental Wizards</li>
	<li>Monsters</li> 
	</ul>
	The enemies gain strength as she advances and later levels will not have weak monsters. In the first level, enemies can be killed in a 
	single hit. In later levels, enemies will require multiple (2 - 3) hits to be defeated. Some enemies may have clothing that gives them
	resistance to certain types of spells. The types of immunity are shown by the clothing. The final goal is to clear all the levels and
	restore her happiness.
</p>
<br />

  <h3>GAMEPLAY</h3>

  <p>The game will work like a side scroller, with the main character able to run left and right, and jump up or down onto so we may scroll up and down. The levels will be designed using a Tiled</p>

  <p>Each spell will have a strange effect on the room as follows:</p>

<table border="5" cellpadding="5">
 <tr align="center">
  <th>Spell in Use</th>
  <th>Visual Effect</th>
 </tr>
 <tr align="center">
  <td>Flare</td>
  <td>The target catches fire</td>
 </tr>
 <tr align="center">
  <td>Firefloom</td>
  <td>A puff of smoke appears on the enemy</td>
 </tr>
 <tr align="center">
  <td>Vector</td>
  <td>The enemy will fly in the direction drawn by the mouse</td>
 </tr>
 <tr align="center">
  <td>Reverse trajectory</td>
  <td>The targeted object moves in the opposited direction</td>
 </tr>
 <tr align="center">
  <td>Zolt</td>
  <td>Launches a lightning bolt at the enemy</td>
 </tr>
 <tr align="center">
  <td>Electromagnet</td>
  <td>Attracts a enemy to a metallic object</td>
 </tr>
