#Misuse of Magic
#Benchmark 2

#authors: Maedeh Safari, Victoria Baeza, Anika Martin

This is a prototype of our final game.
Only the first level's design is implemented. Most screens and UI elements are implemented an functioning.
Our main character Tzahra can play the following animations:
	- Right Arrow: 				Walk right
	- Left Arrow: 				Walk left
	- Up Arrow:					Jump
	- On Lose:					Death
	- Z/X/C + Right:			Casting a spell right
	- Z/X/C + left: 			Casting a spell left
	- On overlap with wizards:	Damage

Our wizards also have animations which are already built. 
After Tzarha reaches the gate at the very end of the level she wins and a win overlay is shown
If Tzarha runs out of health, death animation plays and after the animation is complete a lose overlay is displayed.
